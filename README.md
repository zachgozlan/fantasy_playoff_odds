# fantasy_playoff_odds
I wanted to know how I was doing in my Fantasy NBA league, so I built this playoff odds calculator. I have since updated it twice a year for two fantasy leagues I play in (one NBA, one NFL), the latest version is for an NFL league.

This functions only with Yahoo! leagues, head-to-head, and preferably with points-based tiebreakers (and a very low likelihood of tie scores)
