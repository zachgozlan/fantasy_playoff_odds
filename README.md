# fantasy_playoff_odds
I wanted to know how I was doing in my Fantasy NBA league, so I built this playoff odds calculator.

COF_playoff_probs.ipynb is an outdated version that simply compares the weekly scores of Team X has scored more than Team Y in a week and assigns a win probability based on the percentage of times Team X had the higher score that week.

The "current version" generates a range of predicted scores for the upcoming weeks of competition, given previous weeks, and projects the remaining schedule based on that.
